By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Explain the layered architecture of cloud-based systems, the components at each layer, and locate the performance bottlenecks at each layer.<br/>
 Level 2: Understand.
* Distribute a computation across a set of unreliable computational instances while maintaining a set of well-defined service level criteria such as response availability, consistency, and latency.<br/>
 Level 3: Apply.
* Explain the requirements imposed on a design by a service level agreement (including inward-facing objectives for subservices).<br/>
 Level 2: Understand.
* Make appropriate tradeoffs of consistency versus availability for different features in a design.<br/>
 Level 6: Create.
* Build a system using cluster-level infrastructure.<br/>
 Level 6: Create.
* Analyze and tune the performance of a system constructed from cloud infrastructure.<br/>
 Level 5: Evaluate.
* Classify whether a given event is a breach of privacy or security and suggest an approach to preventing such an event.<br/>
 Level 2: Understand.
* Classify which attribute of reliability engineering is present (or absent) in a system.<br/>
 Level 2: Understand.
* Incorporate one reliability engineering principle in a system you build.<br/>
 Level 6: Create.
   
The outcomes levels are taken from the revised Bloom
taxonomy. Level&nbsp;1 is the simplest level, while Level&nbsp;6 is
the most sophisticated.
