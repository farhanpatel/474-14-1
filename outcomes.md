By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Explain the layered architecture of cloud-based systems, the components at each layer, and locate the performance bottlenecks at each layer.<br/>
  Bloom 2, understand.
* Distribute a computation across a set of unreliable computational instances while maintaining a set of well-defined service level criteria such as response availability, consistency, and latency.<br/>
  Bloom 3, apply.
* Explain the requirements imposed on a design by a service level agreement (including inward-facing objectives for subservices).<br/>
  Bloom 2, understand.
* Compare the tradeoff of consistency versus availability made by proposed designs.<br/>
  Bloom 4, analyze. <div class="commentary"><strong>Still don't know how to operationalize.</strong></div>
* Build a system using cluster-level infrastructure.<br/>
  Bloom 6, create.
* Analyze and tune the performance of a system constructed from cloud infrastructure.<br/>
  Bloom 5, evaluate.
* Classify whether a given event is a breach of privacy or security and suggest an approach to preventing such an event.<br/>
  Bloom 2, understand.
* Classify which attribute of reliability engineering is present (or absent) in a system.<br/>
  Bloom 2, understand.
* Incorporate one reliability engineering principle in a system you build.<br/>
  Bloom 6, create.
