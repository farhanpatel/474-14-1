Issues to be resolved before start of course:

* Team selection. Spread the Python expertise around.
* Installing non-Amazon packages on an EC2 instance.
* Run cluster via [{{site.data.bibliography.hintjens2013.tooltitle}}]({{site.data.bibliography.hintjens2013.url}}), both on {{site.serName}} and EC2.
* [Logging](log.html) in {{site.serName}}.
* Support for adding {{site.serName}} projects to student porfolios.
* Rolling over AWS access key and secret key
* Is there any circumstance when I would only use the first AWS access key?
* Levels 1, 2, and 3 networking (perhaps see [VL2]({{site.data.bibliography.greenberg2011.url}})).
* SFU formatting of this site.
* Ted consistenly misspells "outstanding". He also seems to have problems with "consistently".
