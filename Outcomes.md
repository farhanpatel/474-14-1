By the end of this course, you will be able to:

 * Explain the layered architecture of cloud-based systems, the components at each layer, and locate the performance bottlenecks at each layer

 * Distribute a computation across a set of unreliable computational instances while maintaining a required maximum latency for the overall computation
 * Explain the requirements imposed on a design by a service level agreement (including inward-facing objectives for subservices)
 * Compare the tradeoff of consistency versus availability made by proposed designs
 * Build a system using cluster-level infrastructure
 * Analyze and tune the performance of a system constructed from cloud infrastructure
 * Classify whether a given event is a breach of privacy or security and suggest an approach to preventing such an event
 * Classify which attribute of reliability engineering is present (or absent) in a system and incorporate one in a system you build
