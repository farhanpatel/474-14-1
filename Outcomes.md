By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Explain the layered architecture of cloud-based systems, the components at each layer, and locate the performance bottlenecks at each layer
  <div class="commentary">Bloom 2, understand.</div>
* Distribute a computation across a set of unreliable computational instances while maintaining a required maximum latency for the overall computation
  <div class="commentary">Bloom 3, apply.</div>
* Explain the requirements imposed on a design by a service level agreement (including inward-facing objectives for subservices)
  <div class="commentary">Bloom 2, understand.</div>
* Compare the tradeoff of consistency versus availability made by proposed designs
  <div class="commentary">Bloom 4, analyze. <strong>Still don't know how to operationalize.</strong></div>
* Build a system using cluster-level infrastructure
  <div class="commentary">Bloom 6, create.</div>
* Analyze and tune the performance of a system constructed from cloud infrastructure
  <div class="commentary">Bloom 5, evaluate.</div>
* Classify whether a given event is a breach of privacy or security and suggest an approach to preventing such an event
  <div class="commentary">Bloom 2, understand.</div>
* Classify which attribute of reliability engineering is present (or absent) in a system
  <div class="commentary">Bloom 2, understand.</div>
* Incorporate one reliability engineering principle in a system you build
  <div class="commentary">Bloom 6, create.</div>
