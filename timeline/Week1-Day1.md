Things you need to know about this course:

 * There will be group projects.
 * There will be writing.
 * There will be reading.
 * Python 3 will be the language for all assignments.
 * A credit card is highly recommended for the Amazon assignments. There will be alternate assignments that don't require an Amazon Web Services (AWS) ID, but you will learn the most (and gain the most valuable experience for your portfolio) from using an actual AWS ID (which requires a credit card). All usage will remain within the Free Tierâ€”you will be able to complete your assignments without having your card charged.
 * Material given in class will not necessarily be available in other forms (lecture notes will not be posted on line). But all the key points will be repeated in several classes.
 * At least half of class time will be spent working with material, often in ad-hoc groups, using laptops.
